## An Explanation

Bibliotheca is a vast online library with resources for courses that follow the Ontario Grade 12 curriculum.

> Bibliotheca is currently managed by two students, Manraj Mann and Tegvir Singh. They have devoted their time to making your lives easier (even if it's just by a bit)

A University version of Bibliotheca could be made available shortly. It would be created by the same people (unless you would like to help).

> [!WARNING]
> Although we are trying to push out the most recent versions of everything, there can be mishaps that happen. Be sure to check whether or not the information is still relevant!

## The Main Purpose of Bibliotheca
- Help others succeed in their educational journeys
- Save you from suffering
- Encouraging a streamlined process to find textbooks and course material (We understand time is money, especially for students)
    - Also saving hours of scouring the internet for textbooks
    - No more $$$ spent on stuff
- Just an overall more productive workflow for all students alike
