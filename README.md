# Bibliotheca

###An Explanation

Bibliotheca is a vast online library which contains resources for different courses following the Ontario grade 12 curriculum.

> Bibliotheca's website created by **Manraj Mann** who also dabbles in the main library

> Bibliotheca's main library created by **Tegvir Singh** who devotes his time trying to help others

A University version of Bibliotheca could be made available shortly, it would be created by the same people (unless you would like to help...)

###The main purpose of bibliotheca
- Help others succeed in their educational journeys
- Save you from suffering
- Encouraging a streamlined process to find textbooks and course material (We understand time is money, especially for students)
    - Also saving hours of scouring the internet for textbooks
    - No more $$$ spent on stuff
- Just an overall more productive workflow for all students alike

###Contact

We do not have a contact setup yet, but in the near future (whenever we figure this stuff out) we will.
